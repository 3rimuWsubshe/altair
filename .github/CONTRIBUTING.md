Hooray! A contributor! ðŸ˜„ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽŠ

Thanks for considering being a contributor to the altair project.
Being an opensource project, altair was built to be used by developers, and also developed by developers too!
Every form of contribution counts. A PR, an issue, a tutorial, a blog post, even a star! It all adds up to ensure a better tool for everyone.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect our time.
In return, we should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Contribution Guidelines

For all contributions, please respect the following guidelines:

- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.
- Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bugfix (eg: `.gitignore`).
- Be aware that the pull request review process is not immediate, and is generally proportional to the size of the pull request.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first ðŸ˜„.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Create your own fork of the code
1. Do the changes in your fork
1. If you like the change and think the project could use it, ensure you have gone through the code of conduct document as well as the guidelines specified above.
1. Push the change (we recommend using a separate branch for your feature).
1. Open a pull request.
1. We try to merge and deploy changes as soon as possible, or at least leave some feedback, but if you haven't heard back from us after a couple of days, feel free to leave a comment on the pull request.


## Financial contributions

We also welcome financial contributions in full transparency on our [open collective](https://opencollective.com/altair).
Anyone can file an expense. If the expense makes sense for the development of the community, it will be "merged" in the ledger of our open collective by the core contributors and the person who filed the expense will be reimbursed.
