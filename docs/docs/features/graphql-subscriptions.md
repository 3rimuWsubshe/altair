## GraphQL Subscriptions (with desktop notifications)

You can test your GraphQL subscriptions easily and also get a notification when you are away from the
app (desktop apps only). This is very handy when developing apps that use the realtime feature of
GraphQL, like chatting ang gaming applications that need realtime feedback.
