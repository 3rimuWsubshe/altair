## Plugins

Altair comes with the ability to be extended via plugins. These allow you customize the functionality provided by Altair to be able to do even more than what is directly available in Altair.

> Plugins are still in beta. For that reason, they are not enabled by default. To use plugins, you need to enable experimental features from the settings, then restart Altair. After that, any plugins that are added should be enabled in the app.
