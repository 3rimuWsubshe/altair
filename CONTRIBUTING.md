Every form of contribution counts. A PR, an issue, a tutorial, a blog post, even a star! It all adds up to ensure a better tool for everyone.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect our time.
In return, we should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

## Contribution Guidelines

For all contributions, please respect the following guidelines:

- Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
- Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
- Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds.
- Do not commit changes to files that are irrelevant to your feature or bugfix (eg: `.gitignore`).
- Be aware that the pull request review process is not immediate, and is generally proportional to the size of the pull request.
